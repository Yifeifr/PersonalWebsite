I'm so excited to say that I will participate in the 28/11 cohort of Self-driving car engineer nanodegree program. 
Thanks to the internship experience, I guess it'll easier to start. But what's more, it's a good chance to learn first-hand and transverse knowledge of autonomous vehicles from the senior engineers, then implement all we can imagine.
The program will last 9 months and ~10 hours/week are needed. Hope everything goes well.
