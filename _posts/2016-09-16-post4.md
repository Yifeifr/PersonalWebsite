1.Suppose  m =4 students have taken some class, and the class had a midterm exam and a final exam. You have collected a dataset of their scores on the two exams, which is as follows:
midterm exam	(midterm exam) 2	final exam
89	7921	96
72	5184	74
94	8836	87
69	4761	78
You'd like to use polynomial regression to predict a student's final exam score from their midterm exam score. Concretely, suppose you want to fit a model of the form  hθ(x)=θ0+θ1x1+θ2x2 , where  x1  is the midterm score and  x2  is (midterm score) 2 . Further, you plan to use both feature scaling (dividing by the "max-min", or range, of a feature) and mean normalization.

What is the normalized feature  x(2)2 ? (Hint: midterm = 72, final = 74 is training example 2.) Please round off your answer to two decimal places and enter in the text box below.

-mean normalization
-$$ x = \dfrac{x_i -avg }{max-min} $$

2.2.Which of the following are reasons for using feature scaling?

 It speeds up gradient descent by making it require fewer iterations to get to a good solution.
