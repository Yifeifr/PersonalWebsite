*Each class(or interface) was realized in one file. This assignment aims to practice the usage of interface, the inheritance of class, override, setter/getter and final/static/abstract. 

So we model a relay race. On y va!

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

//an interface to define some behaviors of animal
public interface animal {
	
	void fly();
	void eat();
	void sleep();

}

//we override the Fonction fly()
public abstract class Birds implements animal {
	
	@Override
	public void fly() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("Flying! ");

	}

	@Override
	public void eat() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
	}

	@Override
	public void sleep() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
	}

}

//We can see that there are some athletes in Class Birds, they would take part in the sports meeting.
public class Athletes extends Birds {
	
	String athlete;
	
	public void setter(String athlete){
		
		this.athlete = athlete;
		
	}
	
	public String getter(String athlete){
		
		return athlete;
		
	}
	
	@Override
	public final void fly() {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("It's "+this.athlete+"'s turn! It is flying! ");

	}
}

//now the sports meeting is ready to start, we have four athletes
public class Sportsmeets extends Athletes {

	/**
	 * @param args
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		String athlete1 = "athlete_bd1";
		String athlete2 = "athlete_bd2";
		String athlete3 = "athlete_bd3";
		String athlete4 = "athlete_bd4";

		System.out.println("Readyï¼ŸGO");
		Athletes bird1 = new Athletes();
		bird1.setter(athlete1);
		bird1.fly();
		
		Athletes bird2 = new Athletes();
		bird2.setter(athlete2);
		bird2.fly();
		
		Athletes bird3 = new Athletes();
		bird3.setter(athlete3);
		bird3.fly();
		
		Athletes bird4 = new Athletes();
		bird4.setter(athlete4);
		bird4.fly();
		System.out.println("Done!");

	}
