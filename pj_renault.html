          <p class="light">Abstract: In this master thesis, we present a practical knowledge-based approach to model the Autonomous Vehicle’s (AV) reasoning process following basic traffic rules. The Traffic Rule Manager was built to reason on the traffic regulation. It combines a semantic framework and an inference rule engine, and computes the next high-level decision an AV should follow. After processing, the action-centric results will be generated automatically. In addition, we also discuss the state-of-the-art technologies and development for autonomous vehicles, and introduce the importance and innovation of our subject. In the end, we present some directions of future research</p>
